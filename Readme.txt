## About

The goal of this project was to develop a website for a green tech startup we proposed (E-Sensible). The company would act as the intermediary between green manufacturers (eg. compostable packaging producers) and restaurants that would use those products. The website has an interface for manufacturers that we bring onto our platform and another interface for restaurants that want to be on our platform. Restaurants can scroll through a list of manufacturers, compare their products and prices, and order from the manufacturers that they like.

From customer research we conducted with the surrounding Berkeley restaurants, we believed that the main problem in the green packaging market was information transparency. For example, restaurants might not know about green manufacturers which are affordable - if restaurants could have an interface of our manufacturer clients and see their product prices and other attributes, then that could increase the attractiveness of the green packaging market and bring value to our app. 

From the index page, you can click the "Get Started" button at the top right to see the rest of the web pages we developed. This website is the final product of a line of strategizing on how we can utilize technical skills to bring value to a business.
